"The Symfony framework is well-known for being *really* flexible and is used "
"to build micro-sites, enterprise applications that handle billions of "
"connections and even as the basis for *other* frameworks. Since its release "
"in July 2011, the community has learned a lot about what's possible and how "
"to do things *best*."

"These community resources - like blog posts or presentations - have created "
"an unofficial set of recommendations for developing Symfony applications. "
"Unfortunately, a lot of these recommendations are unneeded for web "
"applications. Much of the time, they unnecessarily overcomplicate things and"
" don't follow the original pragmatic philosophy of Symfony."

"This guide aims to fix that by describing the **best practices for "

"original creator `Fabien Potencier`_."

"**Best practice** is a noun that means *\"a well defined procedure that is "

"believe these will help you build great applications with less complexity."
