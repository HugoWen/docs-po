msgid ""
"**Step 1.** Go to the official Symfony documentation repository located at "

msgstr ""

#: ../../contributing/documentation/overview.rst:41

"documentation; change this value accordingly):"

"**Step 3.** Switch to the **oldest maintained branch** before making any "

#: ../../contributing/documentation/overview.rst:58
msgid ""
"If you are instead documenting a new feature, switch to the first Symfony "

#: ../../contributing/documentation/overview.rst:61

"**Step 4.** Create a dedicated **new branch** for your changes. This greatly"

"memorable name for the new branch:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../contributing/documentation/overview.rst:69
msgid ""
"**Step 5.** Now make your changes in the documentation. Add, tweak, reword "

"In this example, the **base fork** should be ``symfony/symfony-docs`` and "
