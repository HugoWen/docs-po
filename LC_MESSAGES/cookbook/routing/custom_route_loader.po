"A custom route loader allows you to add routes to an application without "
"including them, for example, in a YAML file. This comes in handy when you "
"have a bundle but don't want to manually add the routes for the bundle to "
"``app/config/routing.yml``. This may be especially important when you want "
"to make the bundle reusable, or when you have open-sourced it as this would "
"slow down the installation process and make it error-prone."

"Alternatively, you could also use a custom route loader when you want your "
"routes to be automatically generated or located based on some convention or "
"pattern. One example is the `FOSRestBundle`_ where routing is generated "
"based off the names of the action methods in a controller."
