"The HTTP method of a request is one of the requirements that can be checked "
"when seeing if it matches a route. This is introduced in the routing chapter"
" of the book \":doc:`/book/routing`\" with examples using GET and POST. You "
"can also use other HTTP verbs in this way. For example, if you have a blog "
"post entry then you could use the same URL path to show it, make changes to "
"it and delete it by matching on GET, PUT and DELETE."

"The ``_method`` functionality shown here is disabled by default in Symfony "
"2.2 and enabled by default in Symfony 2.3. To control it in Symfony 2.2, you"
" must call :method:`Request::enableHttpMethodParameterOverride "
"<Symfony\\\\Component\\\\HttpFoundation\\\\Request::enableHttpMethodParameterOverride>`"
" before you handle the request (e.g. in your front controller). In Symfony "
"2.3, use the :ref:`configuration-framework-http_method_override` option."

"Unfortunately, life isn't quite this simple, since most browsers do not "
"support sending PUT and DELETE requests. Fortunately, Symfony provides you "
"with a simple way of working around this limitation. By including a "
"``_method`` parameter in the query string or parameters of an HTTP request, "
"Symfony will use this as the method when matching routes. Forms "
"automatically include a hidden field for this parameter if their submission "
"method is not GET or POST. See :ref:`the related chapter in the forms "
"documentation<book-forms-changing-action-and-method>` for more information."
