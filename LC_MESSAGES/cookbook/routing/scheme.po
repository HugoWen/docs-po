"Sometimes, you want to secure some routes and be sure that they are always "
"accessed via the HTTPS protocol. The Routing component allows you to enforce"

"When generating the ``secure`` URL, and if the current scheme is HTTP, "

"The requirement is also enforced for incoming requests. If you try to access"
" the ``/secure`` path with HTTP, you will automatically be redirected to the"
" same URL, but with the HTTPS scheme."

"The Security component provides another way to enforce HTTP or HTTPS via the"
" ``requires_channel`` setting. This alternative method is better suited to "
"secure an \"area\" of your website (all URLs under ``/admin``) or when you "
"want to secure URLs defined in a third party bundle (see "
":doc:`/cookbook/security/force_https` for more details)."
