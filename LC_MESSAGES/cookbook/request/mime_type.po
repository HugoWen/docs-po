"Every ``Request`` has a \"format\" (e.g. ``html``, ``json``), which is used "
"to determine what type of content to return in the ``Response``. In fact, "
"the request format, accessible via "
":method:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\HttpFoundation\\\\Request::getRequestFormat`,"
" is used to set the MIME type of the ``Content-Type`` header on the "
"``Response`` object. Internally, Symfony contains a map of the most common "
"formats (e.g. ``html``, ``json``) and their associated MIME types (e.g. "
"``text/html``, ``application/json``). Of course, additional format-MIME type"
" entries can easily be added. This document will show how you can add the "
"``jsonp`` format and corresponding MIME type."
