"Sending emails is a classic task for any web application and one that has "
"special complications and potential pitfalls. Instead of recreating the "
"wheel, one solution to send emails is to use the SwiftmailerBundle, which "
"leverages the power of the `Swift Mailer`_ library. This bundle comes with "
"the Symfony Standard Edition."

"Instead of setting up/using your own mail server, you may want to use a "

"called keys) that can be used with the Swift Mailer configuration."
