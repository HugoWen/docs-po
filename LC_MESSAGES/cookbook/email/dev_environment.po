"When developing an application which sends email, you will often not want to"
" actually send the email to the specified recipient during development. If "
"you are using the SwiftmailerBundle with Symfony, you can easily achieve "
"this through configuration settings without having to make any changes to "
"your application's code at all. There are two main choices when it comes to "
"handling email during development: (a) disabling the sending of email "
"altogether or (b) sending all email to a specific address (with optional "
"exceptions)."

"You can disable sending email by setting the ``disable_delivery`` option to "
"``true``. This is the default in the ``test`` environment in the Standard "
"distribution. If you do this in the ``test`` specific config then email will"
" not be sent when you run tests, but will continue to be sent in the "
"``prod`` and ``dev`` environments:"
msgstr ""

"If you'd also like to disable deliver in the ``dev`` environment, simply add"

"You can also choose to have all email sent to a specific address, instead of"

"In the ``dev`` environment, the email will instead be sent to "
"``dev@example.com``. Swift Mailer will add an extra header to the email, ``X"
"-Swift-To``, containing the replaced address, so you can still see who it "

"In addition to the ``to`` addresses, this will also stop the email being "
"sent to any ``CC`` and ``BCC`` addresses set for it. Swift Mailer will add "
"additional headers to the email with the overridden addresses in them. These"

"adding the ``delivery_whitelist`` option:"

"Alternatively, you can open the profiler after the redirect and search by "
