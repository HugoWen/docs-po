"When you are using the SwiftmailerBundle to send an email from a Symfony "
"application, it will default to sending the email immediately. You may, "
"however, want to avoid the performance hit of the communication between "
"Swift Mailer and the email transport, which could cause the user to wait for"
" the next page to load while the email is sending. This can be avoided by "
"choosing to \"spool\" the emails instead of sending them directly. This "
"means that Swift Mailer does not attempt to send the email but instead saves"
" the message to somewhere such as a file. Another process can then read from"
" the spool and take care of sending the emails in the spool. Currently only "
"spooling to file or memory is supported by Swift Mailer."

"When you use spooling to store the emails to memory, they will get sent "
"right before the kernel terminates. This means the email only gets sent if "
"the whole request got executed without any unhandled Exception or any "
"errors. To configure swiftmailer with the memory option, use the following "
