"Unfortunately, the command line context does not know about your VirtualHost"
" or domain name. This means that if you generate absolute URLs within a "
"Console Command you'll probably end up with something like "
"``http://localhost/foo/bar`` which is not very useful."

"To fix this, you need to configure the \"request context\", which is a fancy"
" way of saying that you need to configure your environment so that it knows "

"To configure the Request Context - which is used by the URL Generator - you "

"When using memory spooling (see the :doc:`/cookbook/email/spool` cookbook "
"for more information), you must be aware that because of how Symfony handles"
" console commands, emails are not sent automatically. You must take care of "
"flushing the queue yourself. Use the following code to send emails inside "
"your console command::"
