"It's highly recommended that a functional test only tests the Response. But "
"if you write functional tests that monitor your production servers, you "
"might want to write tests on the profiling data as it gives you a great way "
"to check various things and enforce some metrics."

"The Symfony :ref:`Profiler <internals-profiler>` gathers a lot of data for "
"each request. Use this data to check the number of database calls, the time "
"spent in the framework, etc. But before writing assertions, enable the "
"profiler and check that the profiler is indeed available (it is enabled by "
"default in the ``test`` environment)::"

"If a test fails because of profiling data (too many DB queries for "
"instance), you might want to use the Web Profiler to analyze the request "
"after the tests finish. It's easy to achieve if you embed the token in the "
"error message::"
