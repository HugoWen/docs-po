"Sometimes, you may want to display constraint validation error messages "
"differently based on some rules. For example, you have a registration form "
"for new users where they enter some personal information and choose their "
"authentication credentials. They would have to choose a username and a "
"secure password, but providing bank account information would be optional. "
"Nonetheless, you want to make sure that these optional fields, if entered, "
"are still valid, but display their errors differently."
