"The Symfony Standard Edition contains a bunch of channels for logging: "
"``doctrine``, ``event``, ``security`` and ``request``. Each channel "
"corresponds to a logger service (``monolog.logger.XXX``) in the container "
"and is injected to the concerned service. The purpose of channels is to be "
"able to organize different types of log messages."

"monolog>` and specifying which channel the service should log to. With the "
