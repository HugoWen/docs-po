"It is possible to use the console to print messages for certain "
":ref:`verbosity levels <verbosity-levels>` using the "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Console\\\\Output\\\\OutputInterface` "
"instance that is passed when a command gets executed."

"When a lot of logging has to happen, it's cumbersome to print information "
"depending on the verbosity settings (``-v``, ``-vv``, ``-vvv``) because the "
"calls need to be wrapped in conditions. The code quickly gets verbose or "
"dirty. For example::"

#: ../../cookbook/logging/monolog_console.rst:36
msgid ""
"Instead of using these semantic methods to test for each of the verbosity "
"levels, the `MonologBridge`_ provides a `ConsoleHandler`_ that listens to "
"console events and writes log messages to the console output depending on "
"the current log level and the console verbosity."

"Depending on the verbosity level that the command is run in and the user's "
"configuration (see below), these messages may or may not be displayed to the"
" console. If they are displayed, they are timestamped and colored "
"appropriately. Additionally, error logs are written to the error output "
"(php://stderr). There is no need to conditionally handle the verbosity "
"settings anymore."

"With the ``verbosity_levels`` option you can adapt the mapping between "
"verbosity and log level. In the given example it will also show notices in "
"normal verbosity mode (instead of warnings only). Additionally, it will only"
" use messages logged with the custom ``my_channel`` channel and it changes "
"the display style via a custom formatter (see the :doc:`MonologBundle "
