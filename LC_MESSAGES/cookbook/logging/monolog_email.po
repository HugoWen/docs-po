"Monolog_ can be configured to send an email when an error occurs with an "
"application. The configuration for this requires a few nested handlers in "
"order to avoid receiving too many emails. This configuration looks "
"complicated at first but each handler is fairly straight forward when it is "
"broken down."

"The ``mail`` handler is a ``fingers_crossed`` handler which means that it is"
" only triggered when the action level, in this case ``critical`` is reached."
" It then logs everything including messages below the action level. The "
"``critical`` level is only triggered for 5xx HTTP code errors. The "
"``handler`` setting means that the output is then passed onto the "
"``buffered`` handler."

"If you want both 400 level and 500 level errors to trigger an email, set the"

"The ``buffered`` handler simply keeps all the messages for a request and "
"then passes them onto the nested handler in one go. If you do not use this "
"handler then each message will be emailed separately. This is then passed to"
" the ``swift`` handler. This is the handler that actually deals with "
"emailing you the error. The settings for this are straightforward, the to "
"and from addresses and the subject."

"This uses the ``group`` handler to send the messages to the two group "
