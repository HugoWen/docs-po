"In the chapter :doc:`/cookbook/configuration/environments`, you learned how "
"to manage your application configuration. At times, it may benefit your "
"application to store certain credentials outside of your project code. "
"Database configuration is one such example. The flexibility of the Symfony "
"service container allows you to easily do this."
