"Usually, when you need to create a page, you need to create a controller and"
" render a template from within that controller. But if you're rendering a "
"simple template that doesn't need any data passed into it, you can avoid "
"creating the controller entirely, by using the built-in "
"``FrameworkBundle:Template:template`` controller."

"For example, suppose you want to render a "
"``AppBundle:Static:privacy.html.twig`` template, which doesn't require that "
"any variables are passed to it. You can do this without creating a "
"controller:"

"You can of course also use this trick when rendering embedded controllers "
"from within a template. But since the purpose of rendering a controller from"
" within a template is typically to prepare some data in a custom controller,"
" this is probably only useful if you'd like to cache this page partial (see "
":ref:`cookbook-templating-no-controller-caching`)."
