"The main motivation for writing an extension is to move often used code into"
" a reusable class like adding support for internationalization. An extension"
" can define tags, filters, tests, operators, global variables, functions, "
"and node visitors."

"Creating an extension also makes for a better separation of code that is "
"executed at compilation time and code needed at runtime. As such, it makes "
"your code faster."
