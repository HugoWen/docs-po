"One of the most common use-cases of compiler passes is to work with tagged "
"services (read more about tags in the components section  "
"\":doc:`/components/dependency_injection/tags`\"). If you are using custom "
"tags in a bundle then by convention, tag names consist of the name of the "
"bundle (lowercase, underscores as separators), followed by a dot, and "
"finally the \"real\" name. For example, if you want to introduce some sort "
"of \"transport\" tag in your AcmeMailerBundle, you should call it "
"``acme_mailer.transport``."
