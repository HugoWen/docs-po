"This ``inherit_data`` option was introduced in Symfony 2.3. Before, it was "
"known as ``virtual``."

"The ``inherit_data`` form field option can be very useful when you have some"
" duplicated fields in different entities. For example, imagine you have two "
"entities, a ``Company`` and a ``Customer``::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cookbook/form/inherit_data_option.rst:45
msgid ""
"As you can see, each entity shares a few of the same fields: ``address``, "
"``zipcode``, ``city``, ``country``."

"Start with building two forms for these entities, ``CompanyType`` and "
"``CustomerType``::"

"Instead of including the duplicated fields ``address``, ``zipcode``, "
"``city`` and ``country`` in both of these forms, create a third form called "
"``LocationType`` for that::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cookbook/form/inherit_data_option.rst:119
msgid ""
"The location form has an interesting option set, namely ``inherit_data``. "
"This option lets the form inherit its data from its parent form. If embedded"
" in the company form, the fields of the location form will access the "
"properties of the ``Company`` instance. If embedded in the customer form, "
"the fields will access the properties of the ``Customer`` instance instead. "
"Easy, eh?"

#: ../../cookbook/form/inherit_data_option.rst:127

"Instead of setting the ``inherit_data`` option inside ``LocationType``, you "
"can also (just like with any option) pass it in the third argument of "
"``$builder->add()``."
