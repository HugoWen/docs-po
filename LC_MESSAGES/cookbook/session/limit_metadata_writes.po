"The default behavior of PHP session is to persist the session regardless of "
"whether the session data has changed or not. In Symfony, each time the "
"session is accessed, metadata is recorded (session created/last used) which "
"can be used to determine session age and idle time."

"If for performance reasons you wish to limit the frequency at which the "
"session persists, this feature can adjust the granularity of the metadata "
"updates and persist the session less often while still maintaining "
"relatively accurate metadata. If other session data is changed, the session "
"will always persist."

"You can tell Symfony not to update the metadata \"session last updated\" "
"time until a certain amount of time has passed, by setting "
"``framework.session.metadata_update_threshold`` to a value in seconds "
"greater than zero:"

"PHP default's behavior is to save the session whether it has been changed or"
" not. When using ``framework.session.metadata_update_threshold`` Symfony "
"will wrap the session handler (configured at "
"``framework.session.handler_id``) into the WriteCheckSessionHandler. This "
"will prevent any session write if the session was not modified."

"Be aware that if the session is not written at every request, it may be "
"garbage collected sooner than usual. This means that your users may be "
"logged out sooner than expected."
