"If the legacy application requires its own session save-handler, do not "
"override this. Instead set ``handler_id: ~``. Note that a save handler "
"cannot be changed once the session has been started. If the application "
"starts the session before Symfony is initialized, the save-handler will have"
" already been  set. In this case, you will need ``handler_id: ~``. Only "
"override the save-handler if you are sure the legacy application can use the"
" Symfony save-handler without side effects and that the session has not been"
" started before Symfony is initialized."
