"Prior to Symfony 2.1, the locale was stored in a session attribute called "
"``_locale``. Since 2.1, it is stored in the Request, which means that it's "
"not \"sticky\" during a user's request. In this article, you'll learn how to"
" make the locale of a user \"sticky\" so that once it's set, that same "
"locale will be used for every subsequent request."

"To simulate that the locale is stored in a session, you need to create and "
"register a :doc:`new event listener "
"</cookbook/service_container/event_listener>`. The listener will look "
"something like this. Typically, ``_locale`` is used as a routing parameter "
"to signify the locale, though it doesn't really matter how you determine the"
" desired locale from the request::"

"You might want to improve this technique even further and define the locale "
"based on the user entity of the logged in user. However, since the "
"``LocaleListener`` is called before the ``FirewallListener``, which is "
"responsible for handling authentication and setting the user token on the "
"``TokenStorage``, you have no access to the user which is logged in."

"Suppose you have defined a ``locale`` property on your ``User`` entity and "

"locale value before they are redirected to their first page."
