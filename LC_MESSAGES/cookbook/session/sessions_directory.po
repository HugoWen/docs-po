"By default, the Symfony Standard Edition uses the global ``php.ini`` values "
"for ``session.save_handler`` and ``session.save_path`` to determine where to"

"However, if you have the following configuration, Symfony will store the "
"session data in files in the cache directory "

"method of session management available within Symfony. See "
":doc:`/components/http_foundation/session_configuration` for a discussion of"
