"for the existence of data in the session. This means that if you need to "
"avoid creating a session cookie for some users, it can be difficult: you "
"must *completely* avoid accessing the session."

"flash messages, which are stored in the session. The following code would "

"``flashbag`` will start a session. This may hurt your application "
"performance because all users will receive a session cookie. To avoid this "
"behavior, add a check before trying to access the flash messages:"
