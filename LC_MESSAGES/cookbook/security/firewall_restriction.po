msgid ""
"When using the Security component, you can create firewalls that match "
"certain request options. In most cases, matching against the URL is "
"sufficient, but in special cases you can further restrict the initialization"
" of a firewall against other options of the request."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cookbook/security/firewall_restriction.rst:13

"You can use any of these restrictions individually or mix them together to "
"get your desired firewall configuration."

"This is the default restriction and restricts a firewall to only be "
"initialized if the request URL matches the configured ``pattern``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cookbook/security/firewall_restriction.rst:67
msgid ""
"The ``pattern`` is a regular expression. In this example, the firewall will "
"only be activated if the URL starts (due to the ``^`` regex character) with "
"``/admin``. If the URL does not match this pattern, the firewall will not be"
" activated and subsequent firewalls will have the opportunity to be matched "
"for this request."

#: ../../cookbook/security/firewall_restriction.rst:75
msgid ""
"If matching against the ``pattern`` only is not enough, the request can also"
" be matched against ``host``. When the configuration option ``host`` is set,"
" the firewall will be restricted to only initialize if the host from the "
"request matches against the configuration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cookbook/security/firewall_restriction.rst:124
msgid ""
"The ``host`` (like the ``pattern``) is a regular expression. In this "
"example, the firewall will only be activated if the host is equal exactly "
"(due to the ``^`` and ``$`` regex characters) to the hostname "
"``admin.example.com``. If the hostname does not match this pattern, the "
"firewall will not be activated and subsequent firewalls will have the "

"In this example, the firewall will only be activated if the HTTP method of "
"the request is either ``GET`` or ``POST``. If the method is not in the array"
