msgid ""
"A lot of authentication modules are already provided by some web servers, "
"including Apache. These modules generally set some environment variables "
"that can be used to determine which user is accessing your application. Out "
"of the box, Symfony supports most authentication mechanisms. These requests "
"are called *pre authenticated* requests because the user is already "
"authenticated when reaching your application."

"When using client certificates, your webserver is doing all the "

"By default, the firewall provides the ``SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_Email`` variable to "
"the user provider, and sets the ``SSL_CLIENT_S_DN`` as credentials in the "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Core\\\\Authentication\\\\Token\\\\PreAuthenticatedToken`."

"An authentication provider will only inform the user provider of the "
"username that made the request. You will need to create (or use) a \"user "
"provider\" that is referenced by the ``provider`` configuration parameter "
"(``your_user_provider`` in the configuration example). This provider will "
"turn the username into a User object of your choice. For more information on"
" creating or configuring a user provider, see:"
