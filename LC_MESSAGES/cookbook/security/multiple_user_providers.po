"Each authentication mechanism (e.g. HTTP Authentication, form login, etc) "
"uses exactly one user provider, and will use the first declared user "
"provider by default. But what if you want to specify a few users via "
"configuration and the rest of your users in the database? This is possible "
"by creating a new provider that chains the two together:"

"Now, all authentication mechanisms will use the ``chain_provider``, since "
"it's the first specified. The ``chain_provider`` will, in turn, try to load "
"the user from both the ``in_memory`` and ``user_db`` providers."

"You can also configure the firewall or individual authentication mechanisms "
"to use a specific provider. Again, unless a provider is specified "
"explicitly, the first provider is always used:"

"In this example, if a user tries to log in via HTTP authentication, the "
"authentication system will use the ``in_memory`` user provider. But if the "
"user tries to log in via the form login, the ``user_db`` provider will be "
"used (since it's the default for the firewall as a whole)."
