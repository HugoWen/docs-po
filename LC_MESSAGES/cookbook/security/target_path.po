"By default, the Security component retains the information of the last "
"request URI in a session variable named ``_security.main.target_path`` (with"

" a successful login, the user is redirected to this path, as to help them "
"continue from the last known page they visited."

"In some situations, this is not ideal. For example, when the last request "
"URI was an XMLHttpRequest which returned a non-HTML or partial HTML "
"response, the user is redirected back to a page which the browser cannot "
