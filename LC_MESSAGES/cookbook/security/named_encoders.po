"In the previous example, you've set the ``sha512`` algorithm for "
"``Acme\\UserBundle\\Entity\\User``. This may be secure enough for a regular "
"user, but what if you want your admins to have a stronger algorithm, for "

"This creates an encoder named ``harsh``. In order for a ``User`` instance to"
" use it, the class must implement "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Core\\\\Encoder\\\\EncoderAwareInterface`."
" The interface requires one method - ``getEncoderName`` - which should "
"return the name of the encoder to use::"
