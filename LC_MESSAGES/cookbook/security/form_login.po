"You can change where the login form redirects after a successful login using"
" the various config options. By default the form will redirect to the URL "
"the user requested (i.e. the URL which triggered the login form being "
"shown). For example, if the user requested "
"``http://www.example.com/admin/post/18/edit``, then after they successfully "
"log in, they will eventually be sent back to "
"``http://www.example.com/admin/post/18/edit``. This is done by storing the "
"requested URL in the session. If no URL is present in the session (perhaps "
"the user went directly to the login page), then the user is redirected to "
"the default page, which is  ``/`` (i.e. the homepage) by default. You can "
"change this behavior in several ways."

"As mentioned, by default the user is redirected back to the page originally "
"requested. Sometimes, this can cause problems, like if a background Ajax "
"request \"appears\" to be the last visited URL, causing the user to be "
"redirected there. For information on controlling this behavior, see "
":doc:`/cookbook/security/target_path`."
