"Once a user is authenticated, their credentials are typically stored in the "
"session. This means that when the session ends they will be logged out and "
"have to provide their login details again next time they wish to access the "
"application. You can allow users to choose to stay logged in for longer than"
" the session lasts using a cookie with the ``remember_me`` firewall option. "
"The firewall needs to have a secret key configured, which is used to encrypt"
" the cookie's content. It also has several options with default values which"
" are shown here:"

"It's a good idea to provide the user with the option to use or not use the "
"remember me functionality, as it will not always be appropriate. The usual "
"way of doing this is to add a checkbox to the login form. By giving the "
"checkbox the name ``_remember_me``, the cookie will automatically be set "
"when the checkbox is checked and the user successfully logs in. So, your "
"specific login form might ultimately look like this:"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the user returns to your site, they are authenticated automatically "
"based on the information stored in the remember me cookie. This allows the "
"user to access protected resources as if the user had actually authenticated"
" upon visiting the site."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cookbook/security/remember_me.rst:120
msgid ""
"In some cases, however, you may want to force the user to actually re-"
"authenticate before accessing certain resources. For example, you might "
"allow \"remember me\" users to see basic account information, but then "
"require them to actually re-authenticate before modifying that information."

"The Security component provides an easy way to do this. In addition to roles"
" explicitly assigned to them, users are automatically given one of the "
"following roles depending on how they are authenticated:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cookbook/security/remember_me.rst:129
msgid ""
"``IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY`` - automatically assigned to a user who is "
"in a firewall protected part of the site but who has not actually logged in."
" This is only possible if anonymous access has been allowed."
msgstr ""

"``IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED`` - automatically assigned to a user who was "
"authenticated via a remember me cookie."

"``IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY`` - automatically assigned to a user that has "

"If you have the ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED`` role, then you also have the"
" ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY`` role. If you have the "
"``IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY`` role, then you also have the other two roles. In "
"other words, these roles represent three levels of increasing \"strength\" "
"of authentication."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cookbook/security/remember_me.rst:148
msgid ""
"You can use these additional roles for finer grained control over access to "
"parts of a site. For example, you may want your user to be able to view "
"their account at ``/account`` when authenticated by cookie but to have to "
"provide their login details to be able to edit the account details. You can "
"do this by securing specific controller actions using these roles. The edit "
"action in the controller could be secured using the service context."

"Once the user has entered their username and password, assuming the user "
"receives the ``ROLE_USER`` role per your configuration, the user will have "

"If the user's session ends, when the user returns to the site, they will be "
