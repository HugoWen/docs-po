"In the security chapter, you can see how to :ref:`secure a controller <book-"

"You can also secure *any* service by injecting the "
"``security.authorization_checker`` service into it. For a general "
"introduction to injecting dependencies into services see the "
":doc:`/book/service_container` chapter of the book. For example, suppose you"
" have a ``NewsletterManager`` class that sends out emails and you want to "
"restrict its use to only users who have some ``ROLE_NEWSLETTER_ADMIN`` role."
" Before you add security, the class looks something like this::"

"Your goal is to check the user's role when the ``sendNewsletter()`` method "
"is called. The first step towards this is to inject the "
"``security.authorization_checker`` service into the object. Since it won't "
"make sense *not* to perform the security check, this is an ideal candidate "
"for constructor injection, which guarantees that the authorization checker "
"object will be available inside the ``NewsletterManager`` class::"
