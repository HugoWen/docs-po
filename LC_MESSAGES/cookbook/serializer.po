"Serializing and deserializing to and from objects and different formats "
"(e.g. JSON or XML) is a very complex topic. Symfony comes with a "
":doc:`Serializer Component</components/serializer>`, which gives you some "
"tools that you can leverage for your solution."

"In fact, before you start, get familiar with the serializer, normalizers and"
" encoders by reading the :doc:`Serializer "
"Component</components/serializer>`. You should also check out the "
"`JMSSerializerBundle`_, which expands on the functionality offered by "
"Symfony's core serializer."
