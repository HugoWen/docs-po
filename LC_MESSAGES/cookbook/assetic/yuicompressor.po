"Minified JavaScripts and Stylesheets are very difficult to read, let alone "

"Instead of adding the filter to the asset tags, you can also globally enable"
" it by adding the ``apply_to`` attribute to the filter configuration, for "
"example in the ``yui_js`` filter ``apply_to: \"\\.js$\"``. To only have the "
"filter applied in production, add this to the ``config_prod`` file rather "
"than the common config file. For details on applying filters by file "
"extension, see :ref:`cookbook-assetic-apply-to`."
