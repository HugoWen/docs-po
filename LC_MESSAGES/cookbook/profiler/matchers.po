"By default, the profiler is only activated in the development environment. "
"But it's imaginable that a developer may want to see the profiler even in "
"production. Another situation may be that you want to show the profiler only"
" when an admin has logged in. You can enable the profiler in these "
"situations by using matchers."

"Symfony provides a :class:`built-in matcher "
"<Symfony\\\\Component\\\\HttpFoundation\\\\RequestMatcher>` which can match "

"configuration:"

"You can also create a custom matcher. This is a service that checks whether "
"the profiler should be enabled or not. To create that service, create a "

"This interface requires one method: "
":method:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\HttpFoundation\\\\RequestMatcherInterface::matches`."
" This method returns false to disable the profiler and true to enable the "
