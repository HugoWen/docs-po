"Some forms have extra fields whose values don't need to be stored in the "
"database. For example, you may want to create a registration form with some "
"extra fields (like a \"terms accepted\" checkbox field) and embed the form "
"that actually stores the account information."

"Notice that the ``plainPassword`` field has a max length of 4096 characters."
" For security purposes (`CVE-2013-5750`_), Symfony limits the plain password"
" length to 4096 characters when encoding it. Adding this constraint makes "
"sure that your form will give a validation error if anyone tries a super-"
"long password."

"You'll need to add this constraint anywhere in your application where your "
"user submits a plaintext password (e.g. change password form). The only "
"place where you don't need to worry about this is your login form, since "
"Symfony's Security component handles this for you."
