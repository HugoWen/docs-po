"You can use multiple Doctrine entity managers or connections in a Symfony "
"application. This is necessary if you are using different databases or even "
"vendors with entirely different sets of entities. In other words, one entity"
" manager that connects to one database will handle some entities while "
"another entity manager that connects to another database might handle the "
"rest."
