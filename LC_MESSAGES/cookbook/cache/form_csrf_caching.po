"Typically, each user is assigned a unique CSRF token, which is stored in the"
" session for validation. This means that if you *do* cache a page with a "
"form containing a CSRF token, you'll cache the CSRF token of the *first* "
"user only. When a user submits the form, the token won't match the token "
"stored in the session and all users (except for the first) will fail CSRF "
"validation when submitting the form."

"In fact, many reverse proxies (like Varnish) will refuse to cache a page "
"with a CSRF token. This is because a cookie is sent in order to preserve the"
" PHP session open and Varnish's default behaviour is to not cache HTTP "
"requests with cookies."

"To cache a page that contains a CSRF token, you can use more advanced "
"caching techniques like :ref:`ESI fragments <edge-side-includes>`, where you"
" cache the full page and embedding the form inside an ESI tag with no cache "
"at all."
