"When working with third-party bundles, you'll probably come across a "
"situation where you want to override a file in that third-party bundle with "
"a file in one of your own bundles. Symfony gives you a very convenient way "
"to override things like controllers, templates, and other files in a "
"bundle's ``Resources/`` directory."

"For example, suppose that you're installing the `FOSUserBundle`_, but you "
"want to override its base ``layout.html.twig`` template, as well as one of "
"its controllers. Suppose also that you have your own AcmeUserBundle where "
"you want the overridden files to live. Start by registering the "
"FOSUserBundle as the \"parent\" of your bundle::"

"Despite the method name, there is no parent/child relationship between the "

"Suppose you want to add some functionality to the ``registerAction`` of a "
"``RegistrationController`` that lives inside FOSUserBundle. To do so, just "
"create your own ``RegistrationController.php`` file, override the bundle's "
"original method, and change its functionality::"

"Overriding controllers in this way only works if the bundle refers to the "
"controller using the standard ``FOSUserBundle:Registration:register`` syntax"

"Most resources can also be overridden, simply by creating a file in the same"

"For example, it's very common to need to override the FOSUserBundle's "
"``layout.html.twig`` template so that it uses your application's base "
"layout. Since the file lives at ``Resources/views/layout.html.twig`` in the "
"FOSUserBundle, you can create your own file in the same location of "
"AcmeUserBundle. Symfony will ignore the file that lives inside the "
"FOSUserBundle entirely, and use your file instead."

"The overriding of resources only works when you refer to resources with the "
"``@FOSUserBundle/Resources/config/routing/security.xml`` method. If you "
"refer to resources without using the @BundleName shortcut, they can't be "
"overridden in this way."
