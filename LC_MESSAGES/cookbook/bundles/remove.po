"The Symfony Standard Edition comes with a complete demo that lives inside a "
"bundle called AcmeDemoBundle. It is a great boilerplate to refer to while "
"starting a project, but you'll probably want to eventually remove it."

"This article uses the AcmeDemoBundle as an example, but you can use these "
"steps to remove any bundle."

"To disconnect the bundle from the framework, you should remove the bundle "
"from the ``AppKernel::registerBundles()`` method. The bundle is normally "
"found in the ``$bundles`` array but the AcmeDemoBundle is only registered in"
" the development environment and you can find it inside the if statement "

"The AcmeDemoBundle doesn't have configuration. However, the bundle is used "
