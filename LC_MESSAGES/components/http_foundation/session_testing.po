"Symfony is designed from the ground up with code-testability in mind. In "
"order to make your code which utilizes session easily testable we provide "
"two separate mock storage mechanisms for both unit testing and functional "
"testing."

"Testing code using real sessions is tricky because PHP's workflow state is "
"global and it is not possible to have multiple concurrent sessions in the "
"same PHP process."

"The mock storage engines simulate the PHP session workflow without actually "
"starting one allowing you to test your code without complications. You may "
"also run multiple instances in the same PHP process."

"The mock storage drivers do not read or write the system globals "
"``session_id()`` or ``session_name()``. Methods are provided to simulate "
