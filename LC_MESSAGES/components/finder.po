"A Finder instance is a PHP :phpclass:`Iterator`. So, instead of iterating "

msgid ""
"When searching through multiple locations passed to the "
":method:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Finder\\\\Finder::in` method, a separate "
"iterator is created internally for every location. This means we have "
"multiple result sets aggregated into one. Since "
":phpfunction:`iterator_to_array` uses keys of result sets by default, when "
"converting to an array, some keys might be duplicated and their values "
"overwritten. This can be avoided by passing ``false`` as a second parameter "
