"XPath expressions are incredibly flexible, so there is almost always an "
"XPath expression that will find the element you need. Unfortunately, they "
"can also become very complicated, and the learning curve is steep. Even "
"common operations (such as finding an element with a particular class) can "
"require long and unwieldy expressions."

"Many developers -- particularly web developers -- are more comfortable using"
" CSS selectors to find elements. As well as working in stylesheets, CSS "
"selectors are used in JavaScript with the ``querySelectorAll`` function and "

"CSS selectors are less powerful than XPath, but far easier to write, read "
"and understand. Since they are less powerful, almost all CSS selectors can "
"be converted to an XPath equivalent. This XPath expression can then be used "
"with other functions and classes that use XPath to find elements in a "
